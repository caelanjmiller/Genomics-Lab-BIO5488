Question 1:
Answer is nucleotide as key and the count as the value
{'A': 10382214, 'C': 9160652, 'G': 9246186, 'T': 10370725}
python nucleotide_count.py chr22.fna count
-
Question 2:
Answer is nucleotide as key and the frequency as the value
{'A': '0.265', 'C': '0.234', 'G': '0.236', 'T': '0.265'}
python nucleotide_count.py chr22.fna frequency

Compare the two lists of frequencies. What are the differences? Can you provide a biological explanation for these differences?:
Despite having the same relative nucleotide frequencies, the differences that occur in the biology sequence
might result from biases towards promoter elements, regions near telomeres, CDS regions (potentially GC rich) that are 
biologically relevant. Contrast this with the random sequence and you do not have the same considerations (evolutionarily)
as the frequencies merely act as weights/probabilities for a given nucleotide.

Suggestions:
I think showing other students how to use version control (e.g. git) could be useful so 
changes are incremental
