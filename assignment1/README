Question 1:
Answer is nucleotide as key and the count as the value
{'A': 10382214, 'T': 10370725, 'G': 9246186, 'C': 9160652}
python nucleotide_count.py chr22.fna count
-
Question 2:
Answer is nucleotide as key and the frequency as the value
{'A': '0.265', 'T': '0.265', 'G': '0.236', 'C': '0.234'}
python nucleotide_count.py chr22.fna frequency
-
Question 3:
