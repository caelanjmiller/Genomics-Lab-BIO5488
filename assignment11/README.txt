Question 1: Looking at the distribution of scores by PSI decile, into which two deciles to most PSI sequences fall? What does this result suggest about the efficiency 5’ splice sites?
Most PSI sequences fall into the 0 & 9th deciles; this would suggest that 5' splice sites are quite efficient, any mutation 
-
Question 2: Consider the number of ‘GC’ splice site sequences that fall into the top decile. Are ‘GC’ splice sites more or less likely than ‘GU’ splice sites to be spliced with 90-100% efficiency? What fraction of the splice sites in the top PSI decile are ‘GC’?

-
Question 3: What fraction of the GC sequences in the top decile have G’s at both -1 and +5 positions? Sequences with G’s at -1 and +5 make up about 6% of all possible sequences. Are these sequences enriched in among sequences in top PSI decile?

-
Question 4: (A) Of 41 pathogenic mutations, what fraction have PSI scores in the top decile? In the entire MPSA dataset, 1.7% of sequences have scores in the top decile. Why would the mutation set differ in this fraction? (B) Among the wild-type versions of the pathogenic variants, the mean PSI score is > 99%. What is the mean PSI among the pathogenic variants?
