Question 1:
{How many genes are left after removing genes with zero expression in all samples?}
23259
-
Question 2:
{How many genes are left after removing genes where 20 or more samples have cpm < 1?}
14464
-
Question 3:
{What is the range of library sizes (min, max)?}
(11464513, 20839468)
-
Question 4:
{What is the range of library sizes (min, max) after normalization?}
-
Question 5:
{Compare the two library size bar charts you made. How did the distribution of library sizes change after normalization?}
-
{Briefly discuss why it is important to normalize your RNA-seq data.}
-
Question 6:
{What are the top ten differentially expressed genes according to your FLD analysis? (Copy and paste your function's output.)}
-
{Do these genes make sense given the tissue and groups in the experiment?}
-
Question 7: 
{Does your result point toward one gene with large effect or many genes with small effects?}
-
{Does RNA-seq expression data always give researchers a clear answer?}
-
Question 8:
{How does the study design of this experiment relate to the assumptions made when studying gene expression data?}
-
Question 9:
{If you were going to spend time and money following up on one of these top ten genes, what would be your candidate and why? (There could be many correct answers.)}
